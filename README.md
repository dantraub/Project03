# Project Name
This is my funny game that I have where u BBQ zoo animals in the sky. DISCLAIMER: I didn't eat any of them, also don't plan to eat any of these animals (except for the duck and chicken those are pretty good, especially the duck).

## Implementation
1. The fire is a feature, not a bug (it adds to the theme)
2. Shaders
3. Eyes
4. Spatula? 
5. Smile :)
6. Background
7. Funny Buttons (grill texture)
8. The tiles drop
9. Theres stars that come off them too (the amount you see is the Michelin Rating for that animal)

## References
The eyes and lips belong to Apple Inc.

Other things were borrowed from our assignments

## Future Development
I wanna have the eyes track your mouse but right now they are just PNG's

More levels would be cool too
